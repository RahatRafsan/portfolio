                I've learned the basic HTML & CSS. I can now build any simple to moderate websites. Being a business
                graduate it was a tough challenge to dive into this world of programming but I can tell myself now I did
                the right thing.

                    Started from 2022; I began to grow interest on programming and with that gist of interest I have
                    learned
                    HTML & CSS as of yet. I can now build any simple to moderate websites.
